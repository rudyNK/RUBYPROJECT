# RUBYPROJECT
A FAMILY ADRESS BOOK.
This a simple app that I created to test something that I learn in ruby. 
In this app you have to enter the current folder and run the ruby run.rb file and you will asked to enter some values.
After that all your imput will stored ina json file that will created automatically if you did not created before. 
This is simple but it was a good exercise.
